# RRoad
R programming language codes for road surface analysis on profiling and cross-sectioning from point cloud data.

The repository uses UAV point cloud data for extraction of road environment.

1- Profiling
2- Cross sectioning

For these purposes we use different algorithms and packages in R.

Unfortunately, you have to use your own data set and change the some filenames for importing them to R code.

Thank you for your interest.
